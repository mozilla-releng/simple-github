    Authenticates directly as the app when only `id` and `privkey` are passed

    passed in.

    Args:
        id (int): The id of the Github app.
        privkey (str): A base64 encoded private key configured for the app.
        owner (str): The org or user where the app is installed. If not
            specified, the returned client will be authenticated as the app
            itself rather than as an app installation.
        repositories (List[str]): A list of repositories to limit the app's
            scope to. If not specified, the client will have access to all
            repositories owned by `owner`.
